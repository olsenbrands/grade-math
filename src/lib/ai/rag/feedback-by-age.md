# Age-Appropriate Feedback Guidelines

Research-backed guidelines for providing effective math feedback across developmental stages.

## Core Principles (All Ages)

### Process Praise vs. Person Praise
- **DO:** "You worked really hard on this problem" (process)
- **DON'T:** "You're so smart!" (person/trait)

Research shows process-focused feedback helps students develop growth mindset and resilience to setbacks. Person praise can make students avoid challenges to protect their "smart" identity.

### Growth Mindset Language
- Add "yet" to struggles: "You haven't mastered this... yet"
- Frame mistakes as learning: "Mistakes help your brain grow"
- Emphasize effort and strategy over innate ability

### Avoid Consolation Praise
- **DON'T:** "It's okay, not everyone is good at math"
- This signals low expectations and can discourage students

## K-2 (Ages 5-8)

### Feedback Modality
- Use visual symbols (checkmarks, stars, smiley faces)
- Audio cues enhance engagement (if applicable)
- Keep written text minimal - they may not read it
- Use pictures and diagrams where possible

### Scaffolding Level
- HIGH scaffolding needed
- Break steps into very small pieces
- Provide guiding prompts toward correct answers
- Make feedback perceptually salient (bold, colorful)

### Tone & Language
- Warm, encouraging, nurturing
- Celebrate small wins enthusiastically
- Use simple, familiar words
- Short sentences (5-8 words ideal)

### Example Phrases
- "Great job counting!"
- "You got it! 3 + 2 = 5"
- "Let's try again together"
- "You drew the shape just right!"

### What Works
- Immediate feedback after each attempt
- Correct answer provision (67% of effective conditions include this)
- Physical/manipulative references ("like counting blocks")

## 3-5 (Ages 8-11)

### Feedback Modality
- Written feedback is now appropriate
- Can handle feedback on paper materials
- Visual representations still helpful
- Graphical feedback can be more complex

### Scaffolding Level
- MEDIUM scaffolding
- Can follow multi-step explanations
- Fewer prompts needed than K-2
- Some independence in applying feedback

### Tone & Language
- Encouraging but more matter-of-fact
- Acknowledge effort specifically
- Use grade-appropriate math vocabulary
- Sentences can be longer (10-15 words)

### Example Phrases
- "Nice work! You set up the equation correctly."
- "Your multiplication was right. Let's check the last step."
- "Good strategy using a number line!"
- "Almost there - look at the denominator again."

### What Works
- Explain WHY the answer is correct/incorrect
- Connect to prior knowledge
- Encourage self-checking strategies

## 6-8 (Ages 11-14)

### Feedback Modality
- Written feedback preferred
- Can process longer explanations
- Appreciate clear structure (Step 1, Step 2...)
- Mathematical notation acceptable

### Scaffolding Level
- LOW-MEDIUM scaffolding
- More direct feedback is appropriate
- Can identify own errors with guidance
- Ready for "hint" style feedback

### Tone & Language
- Respectful, peer-like tone
- AVOID embarrassment or condescension
- Be direct but not harsh
- Use proper mathematical terms

### Example Phrases
- "Your approach was solid. The error is in step 3."
- "Good setup. Check your signs when distributing."
- "The concept is right - just a calculation slip."
- "Strong reasoning. Consider what happens when x is negative."

### What Works
- Acknowledge what they DID right first
- Be specific about WHERE the error occurred
- Offer strategies, not just corrections
- Avoid over-praising (feels patronizing)

### Adolescent-Specific Considerations
- Highly peer-conscious - private feedback preferred
- May interpret effort praise as "consolation prize"
- Value autonomy - offer choices when possible
- Respond well to challenges framed positively

## 9-12 (Ages 14-18)

### Feedback Modality
- Written/typed feedback
- Mathematical notation expected
- Can handle technical explanations
- Appreciate efficiency

### Scaffolding Level
- LOW scaffolding
- Point to error, expect self-correction
- Reference relevant theorems/rules
- Assume prior knowledge

### Tone & Language
- Professional, direct
- Treat as emerging adult
- Full mathematical vocabulary
- Concise but complete

### Example Phrases
- "Correct application of the quadratic formula."
- "Error: forgot to consider both roots."
- "The derivative is correct. Check the evaluation."
- "Good proof structure. Justify step 4 more rigorously."

### What Works
- Efficiency - don't over-explain obvious things
- Reference specific mathematical concepts
- Connect to upcoming material when relevant
- Acknowledge sophistication when present

## College/University (18+)

### Feedback Modality
- Professional academic tone
- Full mathematical rigor
- LaTeX notation when appropriate
- Reference theorems by name

### Scaffolding Level
- MINIMAL scaffolding
- Expect independent problem-solving
- Feedback guides, doesn't hand-hold
- May include extension challenges

### Tone & Language
- Academic, collegial
- Peer-to-peer intellectual discourse
- Technical precision valued
- No excessive praise needed

### Example Phrases
- "Correct. The substitution method was optimal here."
- "The integral is set up correctly; check the bounds."
- "Consider: what assumptions does this proof require?"
- "Alternative approach: use L'Hôpital's rule."

### What Works
- Mathematical precision over encouragement
- Point to conceptual understanding (or gaps)
- Suggest extensions or alternative methods
- Respect their intellectual maturity
