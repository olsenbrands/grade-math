# Grade Level Bands for Smart Explanations

This document defines the grade level bands used to tailor math explanations to students' developmental stages.

## Grade Band Definitions

### K-2 (Kindergarten through 2nd Grade)
- **Ages:** 5-8 years old
- **Cognitive Stage:** Pre-operational to early concrete operational
- **Reading Level:** Pre-reader to early reader (Flesch-Kincaid: Grade 1-2)
- **Math Concepts:** Counting, basic addition/subtraction, number sense, shapes
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Concrete, hands-on thinking
  - Limited working memory
  - Learn through manipulation and visualization
  - Need frequent positive reinforcement
  - Short attention spans

### 3-5 (3rd through 5th Grade)
- **Ages:** 8-11 years old
- **Cognitive Stage:** Concrete operational
- **Reading Level:** Developing reader (Flesch-Kincaid: Grade 3-5)
- **Math Concepts:** Multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, basic geometry, word problems
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Can follow multi-step processes
  - Beginning logical reasoning
  - Still benefit from visual representations
  - Can handle written feedback
  - Growing independence in learning

### 6-8 (6th through 8th Grade)
- **Ages:** 11-14 years old
- **Cognitive Stage:** Transitioning to formal operational
- **Reading Level:** Intermediate reader (Flesch-Kincaid: Grade 6-8)
- **Math Concepts:** Pre-algebra, algebra basics, ratios, proportions, geometry, statistics
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Abstract thinking emerging but inconsistent
  - Highly peer-conscious (avoid embarrassment)
  - Can handle more complex explanations
  - Sensitive to perceived criticism
  - Value autonomy and choice

### 9-12 (9th through 12th Grade)
- **Ages:** 14-18 years old
- **Cognitive Stage:** Formal operational
- **Reading Level:** Advanced reader (Flesch-Kincaid: Grade 9-10)
- **Math Concepts:** Algebra I/II, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, calculus
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Full abstract reasoning capability
  - Can understand theoretical concepts
  - Appreciate efficiency and directness
  - Ready for technical vocabulary
  - Self-directed learning increasing

### College/University
- **Ages:** 18+ years old
- **Cognitive Stage:** Post-formal (mature abstract reasoning)
- **Reading Level:** Adult reader (Flesch-Kincaid: Grade 11-12)
- **Math Concepts:** Calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, statistics, proofs
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Fully developed abstract reasoning
  - Can handle technical/academic language
  - Expect professional tone
  - Appreciate mathematical rigor
  - Self-motivated learners

## Selecting the Appropriate Band

When generating explanations:
1. Use the teacher's selected grade level setting
2. Match vocabulary complexity to the band
3. Adjust sentence length and structure
4. Calibrate the level of scaffolding
5. Choose appropriate praise/encouragement style
