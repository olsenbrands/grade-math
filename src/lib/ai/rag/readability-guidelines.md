# Readability Guidelines for Math Explanations

Guidelines for ensuring explanations are readable at appropriate grade levels using Flesch-Kincaid standards.

## Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Targets

| Grade Band | Target FK Grade | Max Sentence Length | Max Syllables/Word |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| K-2        | 1-2             | 8 words            | 1-2 syllables      |
| 3-5        | 3-5             | 12 words           | 2 syllables avg    |
| 6-8        | 6-8             | 15 words           | 2-3 syllables      |
| 9-12       | 9-10            | 20 words           | 3 syllables OK     |
| College    | 11-12           | 25 words           | Technical terms OK |

## Sentence Structure by Grade

### K-2: Simple Sentences Only
- Subject + Verb + Object
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice always

**Good:** "You added 3 and 5. The answer is 8."
**Bad:** "When you added 3 and 5 together, you correctly calculated that the sum equals 8."

### 3-5: Simple and Compound Sentences
- Can use "and," "but," "so" to connect ideas
- Still avoid complex subordinate clauses
- Active voice preferred

**Good:** "You multiplied correctly, but check your addition in step 2."
**Bad:** "Although your multiplication was performed correctly, the addition that you subsequently attempted contained an error."

### 6-8: Introduce Complex Sentences
- Subordinate clauses OK ("When you... then...")
- Can use transitional phrases
- Mix of sentence lengths for flow

**Good:** "When you distributed the negative sign, you changed both terms correctly. However, the final simplification has an error."

### 9-12: Academic Sentence Structures
- Complex and compound-complex sentences OK
- Conditional statements ("If... then...")
- Mathematical phrasing acceptable

**Good:** "Your application of the quadratic formula was correct; however, you'll need to simplify the radical in your final answer."

### College: Full Academic Writing
- Professional academic prose
- Technical precision valued over simplicity
- Assume reader can parse complex structures

**Good:** "The substitution is valid, though one should note that this approach assumes continuity on the given interval."

## Word Choice Guidelines

### K-2: Use Only Common Words
- 90% should be from first 500 most common English words
- Explain ANY math term used
- Use concrete, tangible references

**Instead of:** "Calculate the difference"
**Use:** "Take away to find how many are left"

### 3-5: Grade-Appropriate Vocabulary
- Math terms from their curriculum are OK
- Define new terms briefly
- Avoid abstract language when possible

**Instead of:** "Evaluate the expression"
**Use:** "Find the answer for..."

### 6-8: Building Technical Vocabulary
- Use standard math terms without always defining
- Introduce new terms with quick explanations
- Some abstract language acceptable

**OK:** "Simplify by combining like terms."
**With intro:** "Combine the 'like terms' (terms with the same variable)."

### 9-12: Full Mathematical Language
- Technical terms expected and preferred
- Precision over accessibility
- Mathematical notation acceptable

**OK:** "Factor the quadratic to find the roots."

### College: Academic Register
- Full technical vocabulary
- Reference theorems and definitions by name
- Notation-heavy explanations acceptable

**OK:** "By L'Hôpital's Rule, evaluate the limit as the quotient of derivatives."

## Structural Elements by Grade

### K-2
- Use numbered steps (1, 2, 3)
- One step per line
- Consider bullet points
- Include encouraging phrases between steps

```
1. First, count the apples: 3
2. Then count the oranges: 4
3. Put them together: 3 + 4 = 7
   Great job!
```

### 3-5
- Numbered steps with brief explanations
- Show the math alongside words
- Group related steps

```
Step 1: Set up the multiplication
   24 × 3

Step 2: Multiply the ones place
   4 × 3 = 12 (carry the 1)

Step 3: Multiply the tens place
   2 × 3 = 6, plus the carried 1 = 7

Answer: 72
```

### 6-8
- Steps with mathematical reasoning
- "Because" and "therefore" connections
- Can combine simple steps

```
Step 1: Distribute the 2 across (x + 3)
   2(x + 3) = 2x + 6

Step 2: Combine like terms on the left side
   2x + 6 + 4x = 6x + 6

Step 3: Solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides, then dividing by 6
```

### 9-12
- Concise steps with full notation
- Mathematical justifications
- Can skip obvious substeps

```
Step 1: Apply the quadratic formula with a=1, b=-5, c=6
   x = (5 ± √(25-24))/2 = (5 ± 1)/2

Step 2: Evaluate both roots
   x = 3 or x = 2
```

### College
- Proof-style or calculation-style as appropriate
- Full mathematical notation
- Reference theorems

```
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
∫₀¹ 2x dx = [x²]₀¹ = 1² - 0² = 1
```

## Checking Readability

Before finalizing explanations, verify:

1. **Sentence length** - Average within target range
2. **Word complexity** - Syllable count appropriate
3. **Structure** - Matches grade band expectations
4. **Vocabulary** - Terms are grade-appropriate
5. **Tone** - Matches the feedback-by-age guidelines

### Quick Test
Read the explanation aloud. If it sounds like how you'd speak to a student at that grade level, it's probably right.
