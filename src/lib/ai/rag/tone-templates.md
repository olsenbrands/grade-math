Great job breaking down the problem into steps!
```

### For Incorrect Answers

**Opening:**
- "Good effort!"
- "Almost there!"
- "Let's check this together."
- "Close, but let's review."

**Explanation Intro:**
- "Here's where to look:"
- "Let's go through the steps:"
- "The trick is:"

**Closing:**
- "Remember this for next time."
- "You've got this!"
- "Try using this method next time."

**Full Example (Incorrect):**
```
Good effort! Let's check this together.

The problem: 3/4 + 1/2 = ?

Your answer: 4/6 (not quite)

Here's the correct solution:
Step 1: Find a common denominator
   The smallest number both 4 and 2 go into is 4

Step 2: Convert the fractions
   3/4 stays as 3/4
   1/2 becomes 2/4 (multiply top and bottom by 2)

Step 3: Add the numerators
   3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4 or 1 1/4

The answer is 5/4 (or 1 1/4).

Remember: You can only add fractions when they have the same denominator!

## 6-8 Templates (Ages 11-14)

### For Correct Answers

**Opening:**
- "Correct."
- "Good work."
- "Solid solution."
- "Right answer."

**Explanation Intro:**
- "Your approach:"
- "Solution breakdown:"
- "Here's why it works:"

**Closing:**
- "Strong reasoning."
- "Efficient method."
- "Well executed."

**Full Example (Correct):**
```
Correct. Good work.

Your Solution:
You solved 2x + 5 = 13 by:
1. Subtracting 5 from both sides: 2x = 8
2. Dividing both sides by 2: x = 4

This is the correct approach. You isolated the variable properly and kept the equation balanced at each step.

Solid algebraic reasoning.
```

### For Incorrect Answers

**Opening:**
- "Not quite."
- "Let's review this."
- "Close, but there's an error."
- "Check your work."

**Explanation Intro:**
- "Here's where it went wrong:"
- "The issue is in step..."
- "Consider this approach:"

**Closing:**
- "Watch for this next time."
- "Keep this rule in mind."
- "Double-check this step in the future."

**Full Example (Incorrect):**
```
Not quite. Let's review this.

Problem: Solve 3(x - 2) = 15

Your answer: x = 3 (incorrect)

Here's the correct solution:
Step 1: Distribute the 3
   3·x - 3·2 = 15
   3x - 6 = 15

Step 2: Add 6 to both sides
   3x = 21

Step 3: Divide by 3
   x = 7

The answer is x = 7.

Your error: It looks like you forgot to distribute the 3 to the -2.
Remember: When distributing, multiply EVERY term inside the parentheses.

## 9-12 Templates (Ages 14-18)

### For Correct Answers

**Opening:**
- "Correct."
- "Right."
- "Good."
- (Can skip opening entirely)

**Explanation Intro:**
- "Solution:"
- "Method:"
- (Often not needed if answer is clearly correct)

**Closing:**
- "Efficient approach." (if applicable)
- "Consider also..." (for extensions)
- (Often not needed)

**Full Example (Correct):**
```
Correct.

Solution verified:
x² - 5x + 6 = 0
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
x = 2 or x = 3 ✓

Your factoring was efficient. Note: This could also be solved using the quadratic formula, though factoring was faster here.
```

### For Incorrect Answers

**Opening:**
- "Incorrect."
- "Error in solution."
- "Check your work."

**Explanation Intro:**
- "Correct approach:"
- "The error occurs at..."
- "Solution:"

**Closing:**
- "Review [specific concept]."
- "Watch for sign errors."
- "Remember [specific rule]."

**Full Example (Incorrect):**
```
Incorrect. The error is in your factoring.

Problem: Solve x² + 2x - 15 = 0

Your answer: x = 3, x = -5 (sign error)

Correct solution:
Step 1: Factor the quadratic
   Find factors of -15 that add to +2
   Those are +5 and -3
   (x + 5)(x - 3) = 0

Step 2: Set each factor to zero
   x + 5 = 0  →  x = -5
   x - 3 = 0  →  x = 3

Answer: x = -5 or x = 3

You had the right numbers but reversed the signs. Remember: Check by expanding your factors to verify.

## College Templates (18+)

### For Correct Answers

**Opening:**
- "Correct."
- (Often omitted - just confirm)

**Explanation:**
- Typically only needed if method was unusual
- May suggest alternative approaches

**Full Example (Correct):**
```
Correct.

Your evaluation of lim(x→0) (sin x)/x = 1 using L'Hôpital's Rule is valid.

Alternative: This limit can also be derived from the squeeze theorem or recognized as a standard limit.
```

### For Incorrect Answers

**Opening:**
- "Incorrect."
- "Error."

**Explanation:**
- Precise identification of error
- Correct solution with proper notation
- Reference relevant theorems

**Full Example (Incorrect):**
```
Incorrect.

Problem: Evaluate ∫ x·eˣ dx

Your answer: x·eˣ + C (missing the integration by parts)

Correct solution using integration by parts:
Let u = x, dv = eˣ dx
Then du = dx, v = eˣ

∫ x·eˣ dx = x·eˣ - ∫ eˣ dx = x·eˣ - eˣ + C = eˣ(x - 1) + C

Error: You treated x as a constant. When x is part of the integrand, use integration by parts or substitution.
```
