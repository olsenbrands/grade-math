# Math Vocabulary Progression by Grade Level

This document outlines age-appropriate mathematical vocabulary to use in explanations.

## Vocabulary Guidelines

### General Principle
Use vocabulary that students have been exposed to at their grade level. Introduce terms one level up sparingly, with brief definitions. Avoid vocabulary more than one grade band above the student.

## Usage Guidelines for Explanations

### When a term is AT grade level:
Use freely without definition.

### When a term is ONE level above:
Use with brief inline definition.
Example (for 5th grader): "This is called a 'variable' - it's a letter that stands for an unknown number."

### When a term is TWO+ levels above:
Avoid entirely. Find a simpler way to express the concept.
Example: Instead of "isolate the variable," say "get x by itself on one side."

### Synonyms for Accessibility
Keep a mental list of simpler alternatives:
- "calculate" → "figure out" (K-2)
- "equivalent" → "the same as" (K-2)
- "simplify" → "make smaller/easier" (K-2)
- "distribute" → "multiply each part" (3-5)
- "coefficient" → "the number in front" (6-8 intro)
